let's pick an easy one - item 2.

the executor sends out what we call the Observation Document at the 
beginning of each scan.  actually, it's before the scan begins; during 
normal operation it's roughly one scan ahead.

this document is sent out as an XML document as UDP packets over 
multicast.  i've attached the current schema for this document to this 
email, but note that for any production software, the schema should be 
retrieved from our commons area, so that if changes are made, they are 
picked up automatically.  the multicast information is:
    group: 239.192.3.2
    port: 53001
similar to the observation document schema, for production software this 
needs to be pulled from our commons area (EVLAConstants.java contains 
this information - you're looking for X2DCAF_SOURCE_IP and 
X2DCAF_SOURCE_PORT for group and port).

in the observation document is an element called <name> which will have 
the source name.  something like:
<name>J1331+3030</name>
or
<name>NGC7027</name>
or similar.

the edge frequencies (per item 6) are also available in this document. 
there will be something like:
<sslo Sideband="1" FEfilter="0" BWcode="0" IFid="AC" Receiver="6GHz">
<freq>4488.0</freq>
</sslo>

the rest of the information is going to be trickier, and will probably 
have to come from the CBE.  well, except item (1), which will have to 
come from elsewhere (it might be in the observation document, but not 
as directly as you might think or like).
